This is a small sample learning model, with 40 training and 15 validating images labeled. Also, 10 images and 1 video are provided for testing. 
There are three classes: pedestrian, cyclist and vehicle.

# Tips
1. Run `main.py` to start.

2. You can decrease 【epochs=250】 to finish the first process more quickly .

3. Be wary of your hardware capacity. Raise【save_period=10】 if needed.

4. 【device="cpu"】 could be time-consuming and the whole process will take over 4 hours. 

5. Performance: The mAP50 = 0.724.


Hope this dataset could help~
